# Ruffierinator

The app for taking the Ruffier test

## Description

The application is designed to automatically calculate the result of the Ruffier test, which assesses a person's physical fitness level. The user needs to input heart rate data before, immediately after, and one minute after performing physical exercise. The app will calculate the Ruffier index and provide an assessment of the cardiovascular system's condition.
